# AI Assistant Features

## Overview
The AI Assistant module provides teachers with controlled access to AI-powered content generation tools for creating educational materials. This system helps teachers generate notes, exams, and practice questions based on uploaded syllabus, textbooks, and past papers.

## Features

### 1. Resource Management
- **Upload Educational Resources**: Teachers can upload syllabus, textbooks, past papers, marking schemes, and reference materials
- **Resource Processing**: AI processes uploaded resources to understand the educational scope and content
- **Resource Organization**: Categorize resources by subject, academic year, and form level
- **Processing Status Tracking**: Monitor the status of resource processing (Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed)

### 2. Content Generation
- **Study Notes**: Generate comprehensive study notes based on uploaded resources
- **Practice Questions**: Create practice questions with varying difficulty levels
- **Quizzes**: Generate interactive quizzes for student assessment
- **Exams**: Create midterm and final exams with proper structure
- **Assignments**: Generate homework assignments and projects
- **Revision Materials**: Create revision guides and summaries

### 3. Content Management
- **Content Library**: Organize and manage all generated content
- **Publishing System**: Publish content for student access
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor how often content is used by students
- **Content Filtering**: Search and filter content by subject, type, difficulty, and status
- **Content Preview**: View generated content before publishing

### 4. Analytics & Monitoring
- **Usage Statistics**: Track AI usage patterns and costs
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor success rates and response times
- **Cost Analysis**: Track and analyze AI usage costs
- **Recommendations**: Get suggestions for optimizing AI usage
- **Export Capabilities**: Export analytics data for further analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- **Entities**: `AiResource`, `AiGeneratedContent`, `AiUsageLog`
- **Repositories**: Data access layer for AI-related entities
- **Services**: Business logic for AI operations and content generation
- **Controllers**: REST API endpoints for AI functionality
- **Security**: Role-based access control (TEACHER role required)

### Frontend (React TypeScript)
- **Pages**: Dashboard, Resources, Generate, Content, Analytics
- **Services**: API integration for AI operations
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces for AI data structures
- **Components**: Reusable UI components for AI features

### AI Integration
- **Model Support**: Configurable AI model integration (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for educational content generation
- **Context Management**: Use uploaded resources as context for generation
- **Quality Control**: Validation and quality checks for generated content

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Resource Upload
1. Teacher uploads syllabus, textbooks, and past papers
2. System processes and analyzes uploaded resources
3. Resources become available for content generation

### 2. Content Generation
1. Teacher selects subject and content type
2. Specifies topic focus, difficulty level, and requirements
3. AI generates content based on uploaded resources
4. Teacher reviews and optionally publishes content

### 3. Content Management
1. Teacher manages generated content library
2. Publishes content for student access
3. Monitors usage and performance
4. Exports content for distribution

### 4. Analytics
1. Teacher views usage statistics and costs
2. Analyzes performance metrics
3. Receives optimization recommendations
4. Exports data for reporting

## Security & Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: Only teachers can access AI features
- **Resource Ownership**: Teachers can only access their own resources and content
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track all AI operations for accountability
- **Cost Controls**: Monitor and limit AI usage costs
- **Content Validation**: Validate generated content before publishing
